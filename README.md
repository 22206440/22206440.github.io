# Sydney Skate — Portfolio Template

A clean, ready-to-upload static site celebrating skateboarding in Sydney (Spots, Gallery, About, Contact).

## How to publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo **yourusername.github.io** (public).
2. Upload all the files in this folder (keep the same structure).
3. Go to **Settings → Pages → Branch: main / (root)** → **Save**.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your site will be live at **https://yourusername.github.io**.

## Customise
- Replace images (external Unsplash links) with your own files if you want local assets.
- Edit copy in each HTML page.
- Colours & spacing live in `styles.css`.
